## Project Summary

Modern websites are no longer just static pages — they aim to create engaging user experiences.

This project simulates a cinematic entry into the Iron Man world, starting with an intro screen and progressing into a control-center style home page where users can explore different aspects of Iron Man.

The primary goal of this project is to practically demonstrate how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can be combined to build a visually rich, responsive, and interactive multi-page website.
